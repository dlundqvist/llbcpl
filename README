                         llbcpl

What is it?
-----------

llbcpl is an implementation of an BCPL INTCODE
assembler and interpreter.

Documentation
-------------

Not much is documented yet, but INTCODE is
documented in docs/intcode.txt.

Installation
------------

llbcpl is built using CMake. Brief build instructions:

$ mkdir <build directory>
$ cd <build directory>
$ cmake <source directory>
$ make

In source tree build should also work fine.

Example
-------

Source directory has a compiled example program, to calculate
the first 10 factorials. 

$ <build directory>/ici <source directory>/fact.int
F(1), = 1
F(2), = 2
F(3), = 6
F(4), = 24
F(5), = 120
F(6), = 720
F(7), = 5040
F(8), = -25216
F(9), = -30336
F(10), = 24320

As the interpreter uses 16-bit words, factorials over 8 will wrap.
